Create an arrow that randomly points to a player.

## Before we get started

Complete the following [guided tutorial](/microbit/lessons/spinner/activity), your code should look like this:

### Challenge 1

Modify the random number generator so that it can include new arrows we will create in the next challenge.

* Do **not** run the code yet because it will not work until you have conditions for every random number.

### Challenge 2

Let's add four more arrows that point diagonally.

* Run your code to see if it works as expected

### Challenge 3

Add some other arrows if there are more than 8 players.
