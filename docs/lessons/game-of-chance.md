## Prior learning / place of lesson in scheme of work

Learn how to creating a message with a **game over** to write your message. We will be learning how to create a message using show string and on button pressed.

## Documentation

* **game library** : [read more...](/microbit/js/game-library)
* **show string** : [read more...](/microbit/reference/basic/show-string)
* **on button pressed** : [read more...](/microbit/reference/input/on-button-pressed)

## Objectives

* learn how to use the game library
* learn how to show a string on the LED screen one character at a time
* learn how to use to register an event handler that will execute whenever an input button is pressed

## Progression Pathways / Computational Thinking Framework

#### Algorithms

* Uses diagrams to express solutions.(AB)
*  Uses logical reasoning to predict  outputs, showing an awareness of inputs (AL)
* Represents solutions using a structured notation (AL) (AB)

#### Programming & Development

* Creates programs that implement algorithms to achieve given goals (AL)

#### Hardware & Processing

* Knows that computers collect data from various input devices, including sensors and application software (AB)

#### Communication Networks

* Demonstrates responsible use of technologies and online services, and knows a range of ways to report concerns (AL)

#### Information Technology

* Collects, organizes, and presents data and information in digital content (AB)
* Makes appropriate improvements to solutions based on feedback received, and can comment on the success of the solution (EV)
* Uses criteria to evaluate the quality of solutions, can identify improvements making some refinements to the solution, and future  solutions (EV)
* Evaluates the appropriatness of digital devices, internet services and application software to achieve given goals (EV)
* Recognises ethical issues surrounding the application of information technology beyond school.

Computational Thinking Concept: AB = Abstraction; DE = Decomposition; AL = Algorithmic Thinking; EV = Evaluation; GE = Generalisation
