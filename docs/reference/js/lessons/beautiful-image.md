## Class

Year 7

## Prior learning/place of lesson in scheme of work

Learn how to **show LEDs**,  to show an image on the BBC micro:bit's LED screen. We will be learning how to Show LEDs using simple commands such as Show LEDs and pause.

## Documentation

* **show LEDs** : [read more...](/microbit/reference/basic/show-leds)
* **pause** : [read more...](/microbit/reference/basic/pause)

## Objectives

* learn how to display an image on the micro:bit's LED screen
* learn how to pause your code for the specified number of milliseconds

## Progression Pathways / Computational Thinking Framework

#### Algorithms

* Uses diagrams to express solutions.(AB)
* Represents solutions using a structured notation (AL) (AB)
*  Can identify similarities and differences in situations and can use these to solve problems (pattern recognition)(GE)

#### Programming & Development

* Creates programs that implement algorithms to achieve given goals (AL)
*  Declares and assigns variables(AB)
* Selects the appropriate data types(AL) (AB

#### Communication Networks

* Demonstrates responsible use of technologies and online services, and knows a range of ways to report concerns Understands how search engines rank search results (AL)

#### Information Technology

* Collects, organizes, and presents data and information in digital content (AB)
* Makes appropriate improvements to solutions based on feedback received, and can comment on the success of the solution (EV)

Computational Thinking Concept: AB = Abstraction; DE = Decomposition; AL = Algorithmic Thinking; EV = Evaluation; GE = Generalisation
