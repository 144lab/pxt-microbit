Year 7

## Prior learning/place of lesson in scheme of work

Learn how to `show LEDs` by showing an image on the LED screen. We will be learning how to create a blinking app using a forever loop as well as simple commands, such as show LEDs, pause, and clear screen.

## Objectives

* learn how to repeat code in the background forever
* learn how to show LEDs on the LED screen
* learn how to pause your code for the specified number of milliseconds
* learn how to turn off all the LED lights on the LED screen

## Progression Pathways / Computational Thinking Framework

#### Algorithms

* Understands that iteration is the repetition of a process such as a loop. (AL)
* Represents solutions using a structured notation. (AL) (AB)

#### Programming & Development

* Creates programs that implement algorithms to achieve given goals. (AL)
* Declares and assigns variables.(AB)

#### Data & Data Representation

* Understands the difference between data and information. (AB)
* Defines data types: real numbers and Boolean. (AB)

#### Information Technology

*  Collects, organises and presents data and information in digital content. (AB)
* Makes appropriate improvements to solutions based on feedback received, and can comment on the success of the solution. (EV)

Computational Thinking Concept: AB = Abstraction; DE = Decomposition; AL = Algorithmic Thinking; EV = Evaluation; GE = Generalisation
