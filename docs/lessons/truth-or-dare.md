## Class

Year 7

## Prior learning/place of lesson in scheme of work

Learn how to use an if statement to run code run code depending on whether a condition is true or not. We will be learning how to create the game truth or dare using input an if statement, a local variable, math random as well as simple commands, such as show string and show LEDs.

## Objectives

* learn how to display an image on the BBC micro:bit
* learn how to run code when an input button is pressed
* learn how to a create a variable for a place where you can store and retrieve data
* learn how to declare a new local variable or update the value of a variable
* learn how to return a random number
* learn how to conditionally run code depending on whether a condition is true or not
* learn how to show a string on the LED screen one character at a time (scrolling from left to right)

## Progression Pathways / Computational Thinking Framework

#### Algorithms

* Designs solutions (algorithms) that use repetition and two-way  selection, ie if, then and else.(AL)
* Uses diagrams to express solutions.(AB)
*  Uses logical reasoning to predict  outputs, showing an awareness of inputs (AL)
*  Designs solutions  by decomposing a problem and creates a sub-solution for each of these parts. (DE) (AL) (AB)
* Represents solutions using a structured notation (AL) (AB)

#### Programming & Development

* Creates programs that implement algorithms to achieve given goals (AL)
*  Declares and assigns variables(AB)
* Understands the difference between, and appropriately uses if and if, then and else statements(AL)
* Uses a range of operators and expressions e.g. Boolean, and applies them in the context of program control. (AL)
* Selects the appropriate data types(AL) (AB

#### Hardware & Processing

* Knows that computers collect data from various input devices, including sensors and application software (AB)

Computational Thinking Concept: AB = Abstraction; DE = Decomposition; AL = Algorithmic Thinking; EV = Evaluation; GE = Generalisation
