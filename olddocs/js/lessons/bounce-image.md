## Class

Year 7

## Prior learning / place of lesson in scheme of work

Learn how to creating an **animation**, `basic->show animation` to display a series of images. We will be learning how to create a counter app using a forever loop, the input on shake, and show animation.

## What the teacher needs to know / QuickStart Computing Glossary

* Algorithm: An unambiguous set of rules or a precise step-by-step guide to solve a problem or achieve a particular objective.
* Command: An instruction for the computer to execute, written in a particular programming language.
* Hardware: The physical systems and components of digital devices; see also software.
* Input: Data provided to a computer system, such as via a keyboard, mouse, microphone, camera or physical sensors.
* Loop: A block of code repeated automatically under the programâ€™s control.
* Output: The information produced by a computer system for its user, typically on a screen, through speakers or on a printer, but possibly through the control of motors in physical systems.
* Programmable toys: Robots designed for children to use, accepting input, storing short sequences of simple instructions and moving according to this stored program.
* Program: A stored set of instructions encoded in a language understood by the computer that does some form of computation, processing input and/or stored data to generate output.
* Selection: A programming construct in which one section of code or another is executed depending on whether a particular condition is met.
* Sequence: To place program instructions in order, with each executed one after the other.
* Simulation: Using a computer to model the state and behaviour of real-world (or imaginary) systems, including physical or social systems; an integral part of most computer games.

## Objectives

* learn how to repeat code in the background forever
* learn how to show a series of image frames on the LED screen, pausing the specified time after each frame
* learn how to run code when the micro:bit is shaken; when running code in the web browser, moving the mouse quickly simulates shaking

## Progression Pathways / Computational Thinking Framework

#### Algorithms

* Uses diagrams to express solutions.(AB)
*  Uses logical reasoning to predict  outputs, showing an awareness of inputs (AL)
* Understands that iteration is the repetition of a process such as a loop (AL)
* Represents solutions using a structured notation (AL) (AB)

#### Programming & Development

* Creates programs that implement algorithms to achieve given goals (AL)
* Selects the appropriate data types(AL) (AB)

#### Hardware & Processing

* Knows that computers collect data from various input devices, including sensors and application software (AB)

#### Communication Networks

* Demonstrates responsible use of technologies and online services, and knows a range of ways to report concerns Understands how search engines rank search results (AL)

#### Information Technology

* Collects, organizes, and presents data and information in digital content (AB)
* Makes appropriate improvements to solutions based on feedback received, and can comment on the success of the solution (EV)
* Recognises ethical issues surrounding the application of information technology beyond school.

Computational Thinking Concept: AB = Abstraction; DE = Decomposition; AL = Algorithmic Thinking; EV = Evaluation; GE = Generalisation
