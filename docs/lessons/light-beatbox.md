## Prior learning/place of lesson in scheme of work

Learn how to make a light beatbox music player using the light sensor. We will be learning how to code musical notes using light level, a local variable, conditionals, on button pressed as well as simple commands such as ring tone and rest.

## Objectives

* learn how to control the light sensor on the BBC micro:bit
* learn how to code music on the BBC micro:bit

## Progression Pathways / Computational Thinking Framework

#### Algorithms

* Uses diagrams to express solutions.(AB)
* Represents solutions using a structured notation (AL) (AB)

#### Programming & Development

* Creates programs that implement algorithms to achieve given goals (AL)
* Selects the appropriate data types(AL) (AB

Computational Thinking Concept: AB = Abstraction; DE = Decomposition; AL = Algorithmic Thinking; EV = Evaluation; GE = Generalisation
