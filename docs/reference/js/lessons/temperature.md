## Prior learning/place of lesson in scheme of work

Learn how to get the ambient temperature (degree Celsius °C). The temperature is inferred from the the surface temperature of the various chips on the micro:bit. We will be learning how to get the temperature using on shake, local variables, as well as simple commands such as show number.

* learn how to show a number on the LED screen

## Progression Pathways / Computational Thinking Framework

#### Algorithms

*  Uses logical reasoning to predict  outputs, showing an awareness of inputs (AL)
*  Designs solutions  by decomposing a problem and creates a sub-solution for each of these parts. (DE) (AL) (AB)
* Recognises that different algorithms exist for the same problem (AL) (GE)
* Represents solutions using a structured notation (AL) (AB)

#### Programming & Development

* Creates programs that implement algorithms to achieve given goals (AL)
*  Declares and assigns variables(AB)
* Understands the difference between, and appropriately uses if and if, then and else statements(AL)
* Selects the appropriate data types(AL) (AB

#### Communication Networks

* Demonstrates responsible use of technologies and online services, and knows a range of ways to report concerns Understands how search engines rank search results (AL)

#### Information Technology

* Collects, organizes, and presents data and information in digital content (AB)
* Makes appropriate improvements to solutions based on feedback received, and can comment on the success of the solution (EV)
* Recognises ethical issues surrounding the application of information technology beyond school.

Computational Thinking Concept: AB = Abstraction; DE = Decomposition; AL = Algorithmic Thinking; EV = Evaluation; GE = Generalisation
