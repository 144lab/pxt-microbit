## Class

Year 7

## Prior learning/place of lesson in scheme of work

Learn how to create **animation**, `basic->show animation` to display an animated image. We will be learning how to create an animated image using forever loop as well as simple commands, such as show animation.

## Documentation

* **show animation** : [read more...](/reference/basic/show-animation)
* **forever** : [read more...](/reference/basic/forever)

## Objectives

* learn how to show a series of image frames on the LED screen, pausing the specified time after each frame
* learn how to repeat code in the background forever

## Progression Pathways / Computational Thinking Framework

#### Algorithms

* Uses diagrams to express solutions.(AB)
* Represents solutions using a structured notation (AL) (AB)
*  Can identify similarities and differences in situations and can use these to solve problems (pattern recognition)(GE)

#### Programming & Development

* Creates programs that implement algorithms to achieve given goals (AL)

#### Communication Networks

* Demonstrates responsible use of technologies and online services, and knows a range of ways to report concerns Understands how search engines rank search results (AL)

#### Information Technology

* Collects, organizes, and presents data and information in digital content (AB)
* Makes appropriate improvements to solutions based on feedback received, and can comment on the success of the solution (EV)

Computational Thinking Concept: AB = Abstraction; DE = Decomposition; AL = Algorithmic Thinking; EV = Evaluation; GE = Generalisation
