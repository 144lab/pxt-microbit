## Class

Year 7

## Prior learning/place of lesson in scheme of work

Learn how to use the pins **pin pressed**, `input->on pin pressed` to run code when the user holds the GND pin with one hand, and presses pin 0 with the other hand, thus completing a circuit. We will be learning how to create a love meter using input on pin pressed, a local variable, math random, If (conditional) as well as simple commands, such as show number, pause, and show string.

## Objectives

* learn how to run code when the user holds the GND pin in one hand, and presses pin 0 with the other hand, thus completing a circuit; when you run a script with this function in a web browser, click pin 0 on the simulator
* learn how to a create a variable for a place where you can store and retrieve data
* learn how Boolean operators take Boolean inputs and evaluates to a Boolean output
* learn how to return a random number
* learn how to show a number on the LED screen
* learn how to pause your code for the specified number of milliseconds
* learn how to conditionally run code depending on whether a condition is true or not
* learn how to show a string on the LED screen one character at a time (scrolling from left to right)

## Progression Pathways / Computational Thinking Framework

#### Algorithms

* Designs solutions (algorithms) that use repetition and two-way  selection, ie if, then and else.(AL)
* Uses diagrams to express solutions.(AB)
*  Uses logical reasoning to predict  outputs, showing an awareness of inputs (AL)
*  Designs solutions  by decomposing a problem and creates a sub-solution for each of these parts. (DE) (AL) (AB)
* Represents solutions using a structured notation (AL) (AB)

#### Programming & Development

* Creates programs that implement algorithms to achieve given goals (AL)
*  Declares and assigns variables(AB)
* Understands the difference between, and appropriately uses if and if, then and else statements(AL)
* Uses a variable and relational operators within a loop to govern termination (AL) (GE)
* Uses a range of operators and expressions e.g. Boolean, and applies them in the context of program control. (AL)
* Selects the appropriate data types(AL) (AB

#### Data & Data Representation

* Understands the difference between data and information(AB)
* Uses filters or can perform single criteria searches for information.(AL)
* Performs more complex searches for information e.g. using Boolean and relational operators(AL) (GE) (EV)
* Defines data types: real numbers and Boolean (AB)

#### Hardware & Processing

* Knows that computers collect data from various input devices, including sensors and application software (AB)
* Demonstrates responsible use of technologies and online services, and knows a range of ways to report concerns Understands how search engines rank search results (AL)

#### Information Technology

* Collects, organizes, and presents data and information in digital content (AB)
* Makes appropriate improvements to solutions based on feedback received, and can comment on the success of the solution (EV)
* Makes judgements about digital content when evaluating and repurposing it for a given audience (EV) (GE)
* Recognises ethical issues surrounding the application of information technology beyond school.

Computational Thinking Concept: AB = Abstraction; DE = Decomposition; AL = Algorithmic Thinking; EV = Evaluation; GE = Generalisation
