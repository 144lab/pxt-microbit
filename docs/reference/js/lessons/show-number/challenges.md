### Challenge 0

Welcome! This [guided tutorial](/microbit/xvogbz) will help you show a number on the LED screen!

Show a number on the LED screen! One digit will display at a time, scrolling from left to right.

Make lucky number 7 display on the screen!

```
basic.showNumber(7, 150)
```

### Challenge 1

But we also should pause before showing another number.

```
basic.showNumber(7, 150)
basic.pause(500) // ***
```

### Challenge 2

Let's display the next multiple of 7 on the screen!

```
basic.showNumber(7, 150)
basic.pause(500)
basic.showNumber(14, 150) // ***
```

### Challenge 3

Keep displaying multiples of 7 such as 21 and 28, but don't forget to add pauses between the numbers!
