Year 7

## Prior learning/place of lesson in scheme of work

Learn how to show LEDs with a, `pause` to pause program execution for a specified amount of milliseconds. We will be learning how to show images using forever loop as well as simple commands, such as pause and show LEDs.

## What the teacher needs to know/QuickStart Computing Glossary

* Algorithm: An unambiguous set of rules or a precise step-bystep guide to solve a problem or achieve a particular objective.
* Command: An instruction for the computer to execute, written in a particular programming language.
* Hardware: The physical systems and components of digital devices; see also software.
* Programmable toys: Robots designed for children to use, accepting input, storing short sequences of simple instructions and moving according to this stored program.
* Program: A stored set of instructions encoded in a language understood by the computer that does some form of computation, processing input and/or stored data to generate output.
* Simulation: Using a computer to model the state and behaviour of real-world (or imaginary) systems, including physical or social systems; an integral part of most computer games.

## Progression Pathways / Computational Thinking Framework

#### Algorithms

* Uses diagrams to express solutions.(AB)
* Represents solutions using a structured notation (AL) (AB)
*  Can identify similarities and differences in situations and can use these to solve problems (pattern recognition)(GE)

#### Programming & Development

* Creates programs that implement algorithms to achieve given goals (AL)

#### Communication Networks

* Demonstrates responsible use of technologies and online services, and knows a range of ways to report concerns Understands how search engines rank search results (AL)

#### Information Technology

* Collects, organizes, and presents data and information in digital content (AB)
* Makes appropriate improvements to solutions based on feedback received, and can comment on the success of the solution (EV)

Computational Thinking Concept: AB = Abstraction; DE = Decomposition; AL = Algorithmic Thinking; EV = Evaluation; GE = Generalisation
