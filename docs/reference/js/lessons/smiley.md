## Class

Year 7

## Prior learning / place of lesson in scheme of work

Learn how to **Show LEDs** on the screen. We will be learning show animation, show LEDs and pause.

## Documentation

* **show animation** : [read more...](/reference/basic/show-animation)
* **show LEDs** : [read more...](/reference/basic/show-leds)
* **on button pressed** : [read more...](/reference/input/on-button-pressed)

## Objectives

* learn how to show a series of image frames on the LED screen, pausing the specified time after each frame
* learn how to plot an image to show an image on the micro:bit's LED screen
* learn how to run code when an input button is pressed

## Progression Pathways / Computational Thinking Framework

#### Algorithms

* Designs solutions (algorithms) that use repetition and two-way  selection, ie if, then and else.(AL)
* Uses diagrams to express solutions.(AB)
*  Uses logical reasoning to predict  outputs, showing an awareness of inputs (AL)
* Recognises that different algorithms exist for the same problem (AL) (GE)
* Represents solutions using a structured notation (AL) (AB)

#### Programming & Development

* Creates programs that implement algorithms to achieve given goals (AL)
* Selects the appropriate data types(AL) (AB

#### Data & Data Representation

* Understands the difference between data and information(AB)

#### Hardware & Processing

* Understands the difference between hardware and application software, and their roles within a computer system (AB)

#### Communication Networks

* Demonstrates responsible use of technologies and online services, and knows a range of ways to report concerns (AL)

#### Information Technology

* Collects, organizes, and presents data and information in digital content (AB)
* Makes appropriate improvements to solutions based on feedback received, and can comment on the success of the solution (EV)

Computational Thinking Concept: AB = Abstraction; DE = Decomposition; AL = Algorithmic Thinking; EV = Evaluation; GE = Generalisation
