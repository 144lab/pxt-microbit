Year 7

## Prior learning/place of lesson in scheme of work

Learn how to **set brightness** of an image `led->set brightness` to set the brightness of the LED screen. We will be learning how to set the brightness of the LED screen using LED plot all, input on button pressed as well as simple commands, such as LED set brightness.

## Documentation

* **set brightness** : [read more...](/reference/led/set-brightness)
* **plot all** : [read more...](/reference/led/plot-all)
* **on button pressed** : [read more...](/reference/input/on-button-pressed)

## Objectives

* learn how to set the brightness of the LED screen
* learn how to run code when an input button is pressed
* learn how to turn on all LEDs

## Progression Pathways / Computational Thinking Framework

#### Algorithms

* Uses diagrams to express solutions.(AB)
* Recognises that different algorithms exist for the same problem (AL) (GE)
* Represents solutions using a structured notation (AL) (AB)
*  Can identify similarities and differences in situations and can use these to solve problems (pattern recognition)(GE)

#### Programming & Development

* Creates programs that implement algorithms to achieve given goals (AL)
* Selects the appropriate data types(AL) (AB

#### Information Technology

* Collects, organizes, and presents data and information in digital content (AB)
* Makes appropriate improvements to solutions based on feedback received, and can comment on the success of the solution (EV)
* Recognises ethical issues surrounding the application of information technology beyond school.

Computational Thinking Concept: AB = Abstraction; DE = Decomposition; AL = Algorithmic Thinking; EV = Evaluation; GE = Generalisation
