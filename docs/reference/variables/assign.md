# Assignment Operator

Set the value for local and global variables.

### @parent blocks/operators

Set or change the value of a variable

````blocks
let item = 0
````

Use the assignment operator to set or change the value of a [variable](/microbit/reference/variables/var).

### Declare a variable

Declare a new *local* variable using the [variable](/microbit/reference/variables/var) statement and the assignment operator. Like this:

````blocks
let num1 = 42;
let name = "Joe";
````

The variable's name is on the left of the assignment operator and the variable's value is on the right:

````blocks
let num1 = 42
````
### Notes

* You can use the assignment operator with variables of each of the supported [types](/microbit/blocks/types).
