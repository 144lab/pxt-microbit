# Extensions

You can publish libraries (also known as packages or extensions)
that users can then add to their scripts. These typically
provide a driver for a particular hardware device you can connect
to a microbit.

* [Sample C++ extension](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt-microbit-cppsample)
* [Sample TypeScript extension](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt-microbit/tree/master/libs/i2c-fram)
