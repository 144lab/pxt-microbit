## Topic

Input - Random Numbers

## Class

Year 7

## Prior learning/place of lesson in scheme of work

Learn how to create numbers randomly by using the input of the BBC micro:bit. We will be learning how to create random numbers with input using a local variable as well as simple commands, such as math->random, and show number.

## What the teacher needs to know

**Program:** A stored set of instructions encoded in a language understood by the computer that does some form of computation, processing input and/or stored data to generate output.**

**Algorithm:** An unambiguous set of rules or a precise step-by-step guide to solve a problem or achieve a particular objective. The guided tutorial follows a algorithm and is a precise step-by-step guide to solve a problem**

**Loop:** A block of code repeated automatically under the programâ€™s control. ** The blink program introduces Forever. Forever will repeats code in the background forever.

**Command:** An instruction for the computer to execute, written in a particular programming language.**

## Assessment

### Progression Pathways

### Computational Thinking Framework

#### Algorithms

* Understands that iteration is the repetition of a process such as a loop. (AL)
* Represents solutions using a structured notation. (AL) (AB)

#### Programming & Development

* Creates programs that implement algorithms to achieve given goals. (AL)
* Declares and assigns variables.(AB)

#### Data & Data Representation

* Understands the difference between data and information. (AB)
* Defines data types: real numbers and Boolean. (AB)

#### Information Technology

*  Collects, organises and presents data and information in digital content. (AB)
* Makes appropriate improvements to solutions based on feedback received, and can comment on the success of the solution. (EV)

Computational Thinking Concept: AB = Abstraction; DE = Decomposition; AL = Algorithmic Thinking; EV = Evaluation; GE = Generalisation
