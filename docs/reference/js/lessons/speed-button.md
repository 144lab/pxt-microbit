## Class

Year 7

## Prior learning/place of lesson in scheme of work

Learn how to declare a **Boolean** variable, `var t:= true` `var f:=false` for one of two possible values: true or false. We will be learning how to declare Boolean variables using global variables, if (conditionals), input on button pressed, input running time,  as well as simple commands, such as input on button pressed, and show string.

## What the teacher needs to know

* Algorithm: An unambiguous set of rules or a precise step-bystep guide to solve a problem or achieve a particular objective.
* Command: An instruction for the computer to execute, written in a particular programming language.
* Data: A structured set of numbers, possibly representing digitised text, images, sound or video, which can be processed or transmitted by a computer, also used for numerical (quantitative) information.
* Decomposing: The process through which problems or systems are broken down into their component parts, each of which may then be considered separately.
* Hardware: The physical systems and components of digital devices; see also software.
* Input: Data provided to a computer system, such as via a keyboard, mouse, microphone, camera or physical sensors.
* Output: The information produced by a computer system for its user, typically on a screen, through speakers or on a printer, but possibly through the control of motors in physical systems.
* Programmable toys: Robots designed for children to use, accepting input, storing short sequences of simple instructions and moving according to this stored program.
* Program: A stored set of instructions encoded in a language understood by the computer that does some form of computation, processing input and/or stored data to generate output.
* Repetition: Executing a section of computer code a number of times as part of the program.
* Script: A computer program typically executed one line at a time through an interpreter, such as the instructions for a Scratch character.
* Selection: A programming construct in which one section of code or another is executed depending on whether a particular condition is met.
* Sequence: To place program instructions in order, with each executed one after the other.
* Simulation: Using a computer to model the state and behaviour of real-world (or imaginary) systems, including physical or social systems; an integral part of most computer games.
* Variables: A way in which computer programs can store, retrieve or change data, such as a score, the time left, or the userâ€™s name.

## Objectives

* learn how to get the number of milliseconds elapsed since the script began. 1,000 milliseconds = 1 second
* learn how to create a global variable to store data so that you can use it later in your code and will be accessible across functions and in nested code blocks
* learn how to create a Boolean with one of two possible values: true or false
* learn how to run code when an input button is pressed
* learn how to conditionally run code depending on whether a condition is true or not
* learn how to show a string on the LED screen one character at a time

## Progression Pathways / Computational Thinking Framework

#### Algorithms

* Designs solutions (algorithms) that use repetition and two-way  selection, ie if, then and else.(AL)
* Uses diagrams to express solutions.(AB)
*  Uses logical reasoning to predict  outputs, showing an awareness of inputs (AL)
*  Designs solutions  by decomposing a problem and creates a sub-solution for each of these parts. (DE) (AL) (AB)
* Recognises that different algorithms exist for the same problem (AL) (GE)
* Represents solutions using a structured notation (AL) (AB)

#### Programming & Development

* Creates programs that implement algorithms to achieve given goals (AL)
*  Declares and assigns variables(AB)
* Understands the difference between, and appropriately uses if and if, then and else statements(AL)
* Uses a variable and relational operators within a loop to govern termination (AL) (GE)
* Selects the appropriate data types(AL) (AB

#### Data & Data Representation

* Uses filters or can perform single criteria searches for information.(AL)
* Performs more complex searches for information e.g. using Boolean and relational operators(AL) (GE) (EV)
* Defines data types: real numbers and Boolean (AB)

#### Hardware & Processing

* Knows that computers collect data from various input devices, including sensors and application software (AB)

#### Communication Networks

* Demonstrates responsible use of technologies and online services, and knows a range of ways to report concerns Understands how search engines rank search results (AL)

#### Information Technology

* Collects, organizes, and presents data and information in digital content (AB)
* Makes appropriate improvements to solutions based on feedback received, and can comment on the success of the solution (EV)
* Recognises ethical issues surrounding the application of information technology beyond school.

Computational Thinking Concept: AB = Abstraction; DE = Decomposition; AL = Algorithmic Thinking; EV = Evaluation; GE = Generalisation
