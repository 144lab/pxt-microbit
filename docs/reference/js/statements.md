* [if](/microbit/reference/logic/if) conditional statement
* [for](/microbit/reference/loops/for) and [while](/microbit/js/while) loops
* [function](/microbit/js/function)
* [return](/microbit/js/return)
* [var](/microbit/reference/variables/var) (local variable declaration)

### Operators

TouchDevelop operators include:

* [assignment operator](/microbit/reference/variables/assign) `:=` (to update variables)
* arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, mod) operate on [Numbers](/microbit/reference/types/number)
* comparison operators (such as `>`, `=`) operate on [Numbers](/microbit/reference/types/number)
* boolean operators (`not`, `or`, `and`) operate on [Booleans](/microbit/reference/types/boolean)
* concat operator combines [Strings](/microbit/reference/types/string)
