## Prior learning/place of lesson in scheme of work

Learn the functions of **on data received**, **send number** and **receive number** and chart `plot bar graph` for `acceleration` in the "x" dimension.

* **send number** : [read more...](/microbit/reference/radio/send-number)
* **receive number** : [read more...](/microbit/reference/radio/receive-number)

## Objectives

* learn how to repeat code in the background forever
* learn how to get the acceleration value (g-force), in one of three specified dimensions
* learn how to display a vertical bar graph based on the value and high value.
* learn how to register code to run when a packet is received over radio
* learn how to broadcast a number data packet to other micro:bits connected via radio
* learn how to read the next radio packet as a number data packet

## Progression Pathways / Computational Thinking Framework

#### Algorithms

*  Uses logical reasoning to predict  outputs, showing an awareness of inputs (AL)
* Represents solutions using a structured notation (AL) (AB)
*  Can identify similarities and differences in situations and can use these to solve problems (pattern recognition)(GE)

#### Programming & Development

* Creates programs that implement algorithms to achieve given goals (AL)
* Uses a variable and relational operators within a loop to govern termination (AL) (GE)

Computational Thinking Concept: AB = Abstraction; DE = Decomposition; AL = Algorithmic Thinking; EV = Evaluation; GE = Generalisation
