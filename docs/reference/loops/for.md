# For

### @parent blocks/language
 
Repeat code a fixed number of times.

```blocks
for(let i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
}
```

The Block Editor *for* loop is different than the Touch Develop *for* loop in an important way. The above for loop will iterate *five* times, with the loop variable *i* taking on values 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. The Touch Develop for loop shown below will iterate four times:

```
for (let k = 0; k < 4; k++) {
}
```
