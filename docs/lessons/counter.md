## Prior learning/place of lesson in scheme of work

Learn how to creating a **variable** to keep track of the current count. We will be learning how to create a counter app using a variable as well as simple commands, such as on button pressed, and show number.

## Documentation

```docs
input.compassHeading()

basic.forever(() => {


})

let x = 0

if (true) {

}
