## Prior learning/place of lesson in scheme of work

Learn how to create game blocks to keep track of the current score. We will be learning how to create a game using the blocks called  `add points to score`, `score` as well as simple commands such as on button pressed and show number.

* learn how to run code when an input button is pressed
* learn how to show a score on the LED screen

## Progression Pathways / Computational Thinking Framework

#### Algorithms

* Understands that iteration is the repetition of a process such as a loop. (AL)
* Represents solutions using a structured notation. (AL) (AB)

#### Programming & Development

* Creates programs that implement algorithms to achieve given goals. (AL)
* Declares and assigns variables.(AB)

#### Data & Data Representation

* Understands the difference between data and information. (AB)
* Defines data types: real numbers and Boolean. (AB)

#### Information Technology

*  Collects, organises and presents data and information in digital content. (AB)
* Makes appropriate improvements to solutions based on feedback received, and can comment on the success of the solution. (EV)

Computational Thinking Concept: AB = Abstraction; DE = Decomposition; AL = Algorithmic Thinking; EV = Evaluation; GE = Generalisation
