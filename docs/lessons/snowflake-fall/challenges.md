Coding challenges for snowflake fall. 

## Before we get started

Complete the [snowflake fall](/microbit/lessons/snowflake-fall/activity) activity and your code will look like this:

### Challenge 1

### @video td/videos/snowflake-fall-1

Let's begin creating our falling effect by adding another snowflake with `show LEDs` that displays a different snowflake pattern after the first one. We need 2 frames in the new animation that display both the first and the second snowflake images.

* Run your program to see the cool animation.

### Challenge 2

### @video td/videos/snowflake-fall-2

To finalize our snowflake fall, let's add a different snowflake pattern.

Add a fourth frame to the current animation... or make it your own!
