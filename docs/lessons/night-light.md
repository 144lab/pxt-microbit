Year 7

## Prior learning/place of lesson in scheme of work

Learn how to **set brightness** of an image `set brightness` to set the brightness of the LED screen. We will be learning how to set the brightness of the LED screen using LED show LEDs, on button pressed and set brightness.

## Documentation

* **set brightness** : [read more...](/microbit/reference/led/set-brightness)
* **show LEDs** : [read more...](/microbit/reference/basic/show-leds)
* **on button pressed** : [read more...](/microbit/reference/input/on-button-pressed)

## Objectives

* learn how to set the brightness of the LED screen
* learn how to run code when an input button is pressed
* learn how to turn on all LEDs

## Progression Pathways / Computational Thinking Framework

#### Algorithms

* Uses diagrams to express solutions.(AB)
* Recognises that different algorithms exist for the same problem (AL) (GE)
* Represents solutions using a structured notation (AL) (AB)
*  Can identify similarities and differences in situations and can use these to solve problems (pattern recognition)(GE)

#### Programming & Development

* Creates programs that implement algorithms to achieve given goals (AL)
* Selects the appropriate data types(AL) (AB

#### Information Technology

* Collects, organizes, and presents data and information in digital content (AB)
* Makes appropriate improvements to solutions based on feedback received, and can comment on the success of the solution (EV)
* Recognises ethical issues surrounding the application of information technology beyond school.

Computational Thinking Concept: AB = Abstraction; DE = Decomposition; AL = Algorithmic Thinking; EV = Evaluation; GE = Generalisation
