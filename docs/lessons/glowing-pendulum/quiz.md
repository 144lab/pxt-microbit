Answer the questions while completing the tutorial. Pay attention to the dialogues!

## 1. Why are you creating a 'forever' loop?

<br/>

## 2. Write the line of code to measure the acceleration with respect to the "y" axis and store this value in a local variable called 'acceleration'.

<br/>

## 3. After storing the acceleration in a variable, write the code to take the absolute value of the acceleration, and store this value inside 'acceleration'.
