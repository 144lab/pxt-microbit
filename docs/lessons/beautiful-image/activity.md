Let's learn how to show an image on the LED screen.

To create a new script, go to the [Create Code](/microbit/create-code) page and tap *New Project* under the *Block Editor*.

We will use *show LEDs* to draw an image on the LED screen. This function immediately writes on the screen.

```blocks
basic.showLeds(`
