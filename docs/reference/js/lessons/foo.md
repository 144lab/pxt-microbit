## Class

Year 7

## Prior learning/place of lesson in scheme of work TODO: 

Learn how to creating a **global number variable**, `data->count` to keep track of the current count. We will be learning how to create a counter app using global variables as well as simple commands, such as on button pressed, and show number.

* Programmable toys: Robots designed for children to use, accepting input, storing short sequences of simple instructions and moving according to this stored program.
* Program: A stored set of instructions encoded in a language understood by the computer that does some form of computation, processing input and/or stored data to generate output.
* Repetition: Executing a section of computer code a number of times as part of the program.
* Router: Network hardware which forwards packets of data onwards to the most appropriate hardware to which it is connected.
* Screencast: A recording of on-screen action that is often accompanied by an audio narration.
* Script: A computer program typically executed one line at a time through an interpreter, such as the instructions for a Scratch character.
* Selection: A programming construct in which one section of code or another is executed depending on whether a particular condition is met.
* Sequence: To place program instructions in order, with each executed one after the other.
* Simulation: Using a computer to model the state and behaviour of real-world (or imaginary) systems, including physical or social systems; an integral part of most computer games.
* Sprite: A computer graphics object that can be controlled (programmed) independently of other objects or the background.
* Uniform Resource Locator (URL): A standard for specifying the location on the internet of certain files.
* Variables: A way in which computer programs can store, retrieve or change data, such as a score, the time left, or the user’s name.
* Web server: A service running on a computer (or sometimes for the computer itself) that returns HTML data for a web page when it receives an HTTP request via the local network or the internet.
* World Wide Web: A service provided by computers connected to the internet (web servers), in which pages of hypertext (web pages) are transmitted to users.
