## Prior learning/place of lesson in scheme of work

Learn how to create a catch the egg game game with **plot**, `led->plot` , **unplot**, `led->unplot`, and **acceleration**  `input -> acceleration` to turn on and off LED lights on the LED screen. We will be learning how to create a catch the egg game app using global variables, forever loop, local variable, input acceleration, math min, math max, math random, math mod, if (conditionals), game library as well as simple commands, such as led plot, led unplot, and pause.

## Objectives

* learn how to create a variable as a place where you can store data so that you can use it later in your code, accessible across functions and in nested code blocks
* learn how to repeat code in the background forever
* learn how to turn off a LED light on the LED screen
* learn how to turn on a LED light on the LED screen
* learn how to learn how to conditionally run code depending on whether a condition is true or not
* learn how to learn how to get the acceleration value (g-force), in one of three specified dimensions
* learn how to return the smaller of two numbers
* learn how to return the larger of two numbers
* learn how to return a random number
* learn how to return the modulus
* learn how to show a number of the BBC micro:bit screen
* learn how to pause your code for the specified number of milliseconds
