## Class

Year 7

## Prior learning / place of lesson in scheme of work

Learn how to display a number, `show number` to generate numbers. We will be learning how to create numbers using show number as well as simple commands, such as pause.

## What the teacher needs to know / QuickStart Computing Glossary

* Programmable toys: Robots designed for children to use, accepting input, storing short sequences of simple instructions and moving according to this stored program.
* Simulation: Using a computer to model the state and behaviour of real-world (or imaginary) systems, including physical or social systems; an integral part of most computer games.

## Objectives

* learn how to show a number on the LED screen, one digit at a time
* learn how to pause program execution for the specified number of milliseconds

## Progression Pathways / Computational Thinking Framework

#### Algorithms

* Uses diagrams to express solutions.(AB)
*  Designs solutions  by decomposing a problem and creates a sub-solution for each of these parts. (DE) (AL) (AB)
* Understands that iteration is the repetition of a process such as a loop (AL)
* Recognises that different algorithms exist for the same problem (AL) (GE)
* Represents solutions using a structured notation (AL) (AB)
*  Can identify similarities and differences in situations and can use these to solve problems (pattern recognition)(GE)

#### Programming & Development

* Creates programs that implement algorithms to achieve given goals (AL)
* Selects the appropriate data types(AL) (AB

#### Data & Data Representation

* Defines data types: real numbers and Boolean (AB)

#### Hardware & Processing

* Understands the difference between hardware and application software, and their roles within a computer system (AB)

#### Information Technology

* Collects, organizes, and presents data and information in digital content (AB)
* Makes appropriate improvements to solutions based on feedback received, and can comment on the success of the solution (EV)
* Recognises ethical issues surrounding the application of information technology beyond school.

Computational Thinking Concept: AB = Abstraction; DE = Decomposition; AL = Algorithmic Thinking; EV = Evaluation; GE = Generalisation
