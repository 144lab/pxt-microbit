## Directions

Use this activity document to guide your work in the [jailbreak  tutorial](/microbit/lessons/jailbreak/tutorial)

Answer the questions while completing the tutorial. Pay attention to the dialogues!

## 1. What does a 'break' statement do to a 'loop' ?

## 2. Consider the following directions

Write the line of code that will initialize a number variable to 0. Then create a second variable that tells us when we should `break` out of the loop. Set the `break` to false.

<br/>

## 3. Consider the following directions

Write the line of code to stop incrementing `count` when the button is pressed. (Hint: This will set `should break` to true).

<br/>

## 4. Consider the following directions

Add an `if` statement to determine whether or not we should break out of the loop. Then include the message "I'm Out!" and a smiley face **image** displayed. This will happen right before you `break` from the `while` loop. **Do not include the break **
