Year 7

## Prior learning/place of lesson in scheme of work

Learn how to plot image **on logo up**, `on logo up` to run code when the micro:bit screen is facing up and vertically orientated. We will be learning how to plot an image with the logo up, basic show LEDs, and logo down.

## Objectives

* learn how to display an image on the micro:bit's LED screen
* learn how to run code when the micro:bit screen is facing down and vertically orientated
* learn how to run code when the micro:bit screen is facing up and vertically orientated

## Progression Pathways / Computational Thinking Framework

#### Algorithms

* Represents solutions using a structured notation (AL) (AB)
*  Can identify similarities and differences in situations and can use these to solve problems (pattern recognition)(GE)

#### Programming & Development

* Creates programs that implement algorithms to achieve given goals (AL)

#### Hardware & Processing

* Knows that computers collect data from various input devices, including sensors and application software (AB)

#### Communication Networks

* Demonstrates responsible use of technologies and online services, and knows a range of ways to report concerns Understands how search engines rank search results (AL)

#### Information Technology

* Collects, organizes, and presents data and information in digital content (AB)
* Recognises the audience when designing and creating digital content (EV)

Computational Thinking Concept: AB = Abstraction; DE = Decomposition; AL = Algorithmic Thinking; EV = Evaluation; GE = Generalisation
