# glowing pendulum blocks challenges

Coding challenges for the glowing pendulum tutorial. 

## Before we get started

Complete the following [glowing pendulum activity](/microbit/lessons/glowing-pendulum/activity) and your code should look like this:

**Challenge 1**

Hold the micro:bit in your hand in a dark room. Move the micro:bit like a pendulum and produce a slow image that captures the pattern of the micro:bit LEDs.

**Challenge 2**

Replace "y" in `acceleration(y)` with "x" or "z". Changing the axis will cause the micro:bit to measure the force in a different direction. What differences in the resulting pattern does this replacement make?
