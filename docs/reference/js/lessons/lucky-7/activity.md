Let's learn how to show the lucky number 7 on the LED screen.

### ~

We will use `basic->show number` to display a number on the screen. The first argument (`7`) is the number to display and the second argument (`150`) is duration in milliseconds between column scroll. For example, you can reduce `150` to `100` to speed up the scrolling.

```
basic.showNumber(7, 150) // ***
```
