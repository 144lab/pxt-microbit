## Prior learning/place of lesson in scheme of work

Learn how to use running time. We will be learning how to create a pogo game using variables, forever loop, conditionals, on button pressed, as well as simple commands, such as show LEDs and clear screen.

## Objectives

* learn how to create a function as a unit of code that performs a specific task and returns a result
* learn how arithmetic operators operate on numbers and return a number
* learn how to repeat code in the background forever
* learn how to conditionally run code depending on whether a condition is true or not
* learn how to run code when an input button is pressed
* learn how to pause your code for the specified number of milliseconds

## Progression Pathways / Computational Thinking Framework

#### Algorithms

* Designs solutions (algorithms) that use repetition and two-way  selection, ie if, then and else.(AL)
* Uses diagrams to express solutions.(AB)
*  Uses logical reasoning to predict  outputs, showing an awareness of inputs (AL)
* Represents solutions using a structured notation (AL) (AB)

#### Programming & Development

* Creates programs that implement algorithms to achieve given goals (AL)
*  Declares and assigns variables(AB)
* Uses post-tested loop e.g.‘until’,and a sequence of selection statements in programs,including an if,then and else statement(AL)
* Understands the difference between, and appropriately uses if and if, then and else statements(AL)
* Uses a variable and relational operators within a loop to govern termination (AL) (GE)
* Uses a range of operators and expressions e.g. Boolean, and applies them in the context of program control. (AL)
* Selects the appropriate data types(AL) (AB

Computational Thinking Concept: AB = Abstraction; DE = Decomposition; AL = Algorithmic Thinking; EV = Evaluation; GE = Generalisation
